# Ex.No:1(A) INTRODUCTION TO JAVA PROGRAMMING, DATA TYPES, VARIABLES AND OPERATORS

## AIM:
Demonstrate basic variable declarations and arithmetic operators in Java.

## ALGORITHM :
1. Start the program.
2. Declare variables needed for arithmetic operations.
3. Perform basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus).
4. Store results in separate variables.
5. Display all results and end the program.

## PROGRAM:

### to implement variables and Operators using Java

## Sourcecode.java:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        double b = 5.5;
        int sum = a + 5;
        int difference = a - 3;
        double product = a * b;
        double quotient = a / b;
        int remainder = a % 3;

        System.out.println("Addition: " + sum);
        System.out.println("Subtraction: " + difference);
        System.out.println("Multiplication: " + product);
        System.out.println("Division: " + quotient);
        System.out.println("Modulus: " + remainder);
    }
}
```

## OUTPUT:
```
Addition: 15
Subtraction: 7
Multiplication: 55.0
Division: 1.8181818181818181
Modulus: 1
```
## RESULT:


Program executed successfully.
