# Ex.No:4(C) COMPOSITION IN JAVA

## AIM:

Demonstrate composition by creating a class that contains another class as part of its structure.

## ALGORITHM :

1. Start the program.
2. Create a component class that represents a part of a bigger object.
3. Create a main class that contains an instance of the component class.
4. Initialize the composition in the constructor.
5. Use the composed object to perform actions and display results.
